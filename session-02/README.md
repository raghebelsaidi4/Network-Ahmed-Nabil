# IP Network Topology and Types

Network topology refers to the arrangement of different elements in a computer network. It defines how devices are connected and how data flows within the network.

## IP Network Topologies

### 1. Point-to-Point Topology
- **Advantages**: Simple, high performance.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited to two devices, not scalable.

### 2. Ring Topology
- **Advantages**: Reduces packet collisions, easy fault isolation.
- **Disadvantages**: Single failure can disrupt the network, difficult to modify.

### 3. Mesh Topology
- **Advantages**: High redundancy, reliable.
- **Disadvantages**: Expensive, complex to manage.

### 4. Bus Topology
- **Advantages**: Easy to set up, requires less cable.
- **Disadvantages**: Central cable failure disrupts the network, performance degrades with more devices.

### 5. Star Topology
- **Advantages**: Easy to install, failure of one device does not affect others.
- **Disadvantages**: Central hub is a single point of failure, requires more cable.

## IP Network Types

### 1. LAN (Local Area Network)
- **Description**: A network within a local area (e.g., home, office).
- **Characteristics**: High data transfer rates, limited geographic area.

### 2. WAN (Wide Area Network)
- **Description**: A network that spans large geographic areas (e.g., internet).
- **Characteristics**: Lower data transfer rates, uses public or private infrastructure.

#### a. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- **Description**: A network that spans a city or campus.
- **Characteristics**: Larger than LAN, smaller than WAN.

#### b. CAN (Campus Area Network)
- **Description**: A network that connects multiple buildings within a localized area.
- **Characteristics**: High-speed connectivity within a limited geographic area.
